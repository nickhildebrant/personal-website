  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I began learning Computer Science in 2016 as a freshman in highschool but the excitment to learning programming began
    when I was elementary. I always wanted to take things apart, see how the mechanics of something help it work, finding
    flaws, and putting it back together. Currently I am completing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a Computer
    Gaming certificate with plans to pursue a Master's Degree with research pertaining to Graphics and Artificial Intelligence.
    I love to challenge myself to learn new things everyday doing things like learning a foreign language or even building
    this website!
